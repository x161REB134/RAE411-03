# RAE411-03
Week 3 assignment for course RAE411
## Week3 task: Get json data from the web page, display it using HTML and JS. Create 2 graphs from the received data. 
## To compleate the task, i created 5 files: 1 HTML, 1 Python, 1 JSON, 2 JS.
### Python script is used to get the JSON data from URL and write it in JSON data file. This method was used, since getting JSON data using JS was still unavailable. (More info on RAE411-02 repository)
### From the created data JSON file, JS is used to work with this data - Createing 2 graphs (Each graph has its own JS file)
### HTML is used to display the data and graphs. Decied to create seperate files, so that the code is easier to understand and see which code is responsible for what.
